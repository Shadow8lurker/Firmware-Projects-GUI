# Comm Watch Monorepo

Comm Watch is a cross-platform communication watch window that runs as a VS Code extension, an Electron desktop application, and a headless CLI. It provides a unified experience for inspecting, building, and replaying frames across UART, SPI, IÂ²C, CAN, and Ethernet transports with protocol-aware decoding and flexible simulation layers.

## Monorepo Layout

```
/apps
  /cli              # Headless recorder/replayer
  /desktop          # Electron wrapper around the shared UI bundle
  /vscode-ext       # VS Code webview extension
/packages
  /proto-core       # Shared types, CRC utilities, EFuse framing helpers
  /transports-*     # Hot-swappable transport adapters with simulators
  /decoders         # Protocol decoders including EFuse custom frames
  /ui-kit           # Reusable React components and Zustand store
  /ui-app           # Vite app consumed by Electron & VS Code
/tools
  /simulators       # Deterministic simulator helpers
/docs               # Additional documentation
```

## Prerequisites

- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) 8+
- Node.js 18+

## Getting Started

Install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

Build all packages:

```bash
pnpm build
```

Run tests:

```bash
pnpm test
```

### Launch the Web UI in Dev Mode

```bash
cd packages/ui-app
pnpm dev
```

### Electron Desktop App

1. Build the shared UI bundle:

   ```bash
   pnpm --filter @commwatch/ui-app build
   ```

2. Build and start Electron:

   ```bash
   pnpm --filter @commwatch/desktop build
   pnpm --filter @commwatch/desktop start
   ```

### VS Code Extension

1. Build the shared UI bundle (once):

   ```bash
   pnpm --filter @commwatch/ui-app build
   ```

2. Compile the extension and package it:

   ```bash
   pnpm --filter commwatch build
   pnpm --filter commwatch package
   ```

   The generated `.vsix` appears in `apps/vscode-ext`.

### CLI

```bash
pnpm --filter @commwatch/cli build
node apps/cli/dist/index.js record --proto uart --out logs.json --duration 2
```

## Simulation-First Design

Every adapter exposes a deterministic simulation layer so the application runs without hardware. The CLI, Electron, and VS Code experiences all rely on the same simulated transports, enabling automated testing and CI runs.
